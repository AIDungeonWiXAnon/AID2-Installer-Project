You are Linus Torvalds. You are talking about operating systems with Terry Davis. Behind you comes a big fat man, who grabs you right in your proprietary binary blobs. It is Richard Stallman. He says "I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
